1. All the Makefiles have the instructions to build the Docker images for any updates.
  Obviously `docker` is necessary to do so.

2. To run the cli, please run:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
first then
$ python cli.py

3. Please make sure that you are in this directory when you call the cli.py.
4. You can specify a custom csv file using the options, see the help message from the cli itself.
5. But to be hassle-free, just place your IAM credentials.csv in this current directory.
